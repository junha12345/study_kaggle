Space to store various concepts and skills necessary for machine learning

### step 1

    자료형구조 데이터 학습공부
  
    데이터 전처리 과정에서 쓸수있는 method 공부
  
    hyperparameter tuning방법, 활용
  
    validation을 높일수 있는 방법 모색




## keep in mind

  1. when the results doesn't come out the way i want in to

    spend more time in feature enginneering
    
    add/remove data.. change something different
    
    try many things (do not think 'it gonna be bad')
    
    check overfitting & data unbalancing




## part of thinking apart
    1. · Computer Vision: For image classification using deep learning, a rule of thumb is 1,000 images per class, where this number can go down significantly if one uses pre-trained models
